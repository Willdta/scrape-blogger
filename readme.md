### About The App

An application that scrapes various articles that allows users to vote and comment on.

You do not need an account to view articles and or see engagement however to leave comments and votes you must create an account.

The genre of data that is scraped is currently undecided however it will include interesting pieces of news (at least we hope). New articles will be scraped daily and all articles that are added will be available to you.
